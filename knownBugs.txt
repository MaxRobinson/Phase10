Known Bugs, 

Hitting on a run is a no go. 
Phasing with multiple wild cards in your phase does not work.
Skipping does not currently work. ( can play skip card, the players turn is just not skipped ) 

unsure about how more than 2 players works. 
proxy player currently doesn't seem to work correctly.
